# Game of War

Remember the card game ["War"](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/)?

Two players start the game by splitting a deck of 52 standard playing cards
evenly. Each stack is facedown, and players cannot look at the cards in their
stack or rearrange them.

The objective of the game is to play until one player has all 52 cards in their
stack.
